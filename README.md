# 180-days

I saw a post on X, [this](https://x.com/cneuralnetwork/status/1937154765215175129) one here. And decided to hop on.

## What shall I do for 180 days ?

1. Touch Typing: Master the QWERTY first, well enough cover my daily typing at a normal rate.
2. Competitive Programming: Do atleast one problem each day. Profile is [here](https://leetcode.com/u/5kyguy/).

I know these both can be tracked using online tools, but creating this repo for easy data collection.
